I recently challenged myself to code for 30 consecutive days, and I wanted to share some insights gained form the experience. 

## Why you should do a 30-day challenge:
Before deciding to do a challenge, its best to have a reason for attempting one. In my case, I do development work at my job, but struggle to find free time to program after work. So the motivation for this challenge was to expand my technical skills, and develop a habit of programming at home.

Besides developing new skills or forming a habit, completing a 30-day challenge can offer many other benefits:

* It can force you to solve problems you may otherwise put on the back burner.
* Learn how to research solutions to problems, and gain knowledge to ask the right questions.
* It can teach you to break down problems into smaller steps.
* And can be a real confidence booster for some people.

## Tips to help you succeed with your challenge:

**Set a realistic goal with clear success conditions:**
Once you have a reason for doing a challenge, it’s helpful to set a realistic goal and conditions for success. After selecting a goal, the first step is to create conditions which define if the challenge was successful or not. For example if your goal was to run a marathon a condition could be that you need to run the entire 42.195 kilometres for the goal to be considered a success. In my case, I set two conditions, 1) I needed to perform at least one code commit a day, and 2) commits need to occur over 30 consecutive days.

By establishing a concrete goal with conditions at the beginning of a challenge, it provides a clear idea of success or failure. This will help you stay accountable and motivated throughout the challenge.

**Break down a goal into smaller tasks:**
Another tip is to break down a goal into a sequence of steps. For some people this can be real barrier to success, so I recommend writing down a list of tasks which need to be performed to accomplish a goal. The key is to make sure each task is manageable and can be performed during a short time-frame. For example, if a task is going to require multiple days to accomplish, try to break the task into multiple smaller tasks.

**Be flexible:**
How you broke down a goal at the start of a personal challenge will likely change as you make progress. Being flexible in how you accomplish a goal is also important. Its fine if you need to re-order, add, or remove tasks from your initially goal break down.

**Set a consistent time to work toward your goal:**
Set a schedule to work on a goal. Having a consistent time can be helpful on days you don’t want to work towards your goal.

**Don’t wait to get started:**
Lastly, don’t wait to get started with a challenge. Often the first step can be the hardest, and once a few days are under your belt, you’ll begin to establish a new habit.

For those who struggle with challenges, I hope this post helps you in future goals.
