Recently I tried to open a csv file with utf-8 encoding in excel and it was displayed incorrectly. One possible solution to this problem is adding a Byte Order Mark at the start of the file, so it can be read correctly by excel.

After searching stack overflow, I came across a few posts that explained how to add a BOM to a file and how to check files for a BOM. 

**How to add a BOM with sed or printf:**
Here are two examples of how to add a BOM. The first example edits the sample export.csv file by adding a BOM (the unicode character 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF) at the start of the first line of the file. The second concatenates printf's BOM output with the export.csv file, and is output to a new file.

sed Example: `sed -i '1s/^/\xEF\xBB\xBF/' export.csv`

printf Example: `printf '\xEF\xBB\xBF' | cat - export.csv > export-with-bom.csv`

**How to check if files contain a BOM:**
If you're not sure if a file has a BOM, you can use the following command on the directory containing the file, and if it has a BOM it will be shown in the grep's output.

Syntax: `grep -rl $'\xEF\xBB\xBF' .`

Note: If your encoding isn't utf-8, you will need to use a different unicode character at the start for the BOM. See the table on [wikipedia page on BOM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) for further details.

**Alternative solution, LibreOffice:**
An alternative to this solution, is to use a different spreadsheet software. One good choice is the open source solution [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) which should have no problems reading the csv file without a BOM.
