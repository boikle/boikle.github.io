title: "Netstat: Processes and Port Numbers"

Earlier today I needed to kill a process that was occupying a specific port on a network. After a quick search online I learned from this [website](http://mylinuxnotebook.blogspot.ca/2008/08/display-linux-open-ports-with-netstat.html) that the program Netstat can list listening sockets and provide the program PID's, which are using a specific port. The command to do this is as follows;

`netstat -lp`

This approach can be further refined if you know which port to look for, by piping a grep command afterwards with a specific port number;

`netstat -lp | grep <port #>`
