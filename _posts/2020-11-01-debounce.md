While reading some code the other day, I came across a debounce function for the first time, and wanted to share what I’ve learned.

Debouncing is a JavaScript technique to reduce the number of times a function is executed. It’s commonly used when dealing with multiple events in a short time span. An example would be requiring a set amount of time to pass before executing a function after a button is pressed. Even if you were to rapidly click the same button 15 times, the debounce code would require the set amount of uninterrupted time to pass before executing the function.

Another common example, is how to handle the resizing of a browser window. If you have code that manipulates the DOM every time the browser resizes, it may make more sense to wait for the user to stop resizing before executing that code. This could be accomplished with a debounce function.

In an effort to learn this technique, I followed the helpful debouncing tutorial on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/debounce-explained-how-to-make-your-javascript-wait-for-your-user-to-finish-typing-2/), and produced the following example to see how debouncing scroll events with a 0.5 sec delay compares to regular un-debounced events.
