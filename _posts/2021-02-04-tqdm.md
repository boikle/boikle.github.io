I was developing some data processing scripts to run through some large spatial datasets. Since the scripts would take a long time to complete, I wanted to indicate progress so I would know how close I was to finishing a script while it was running.

Often in these situations, I’ll just add some basic print statements to show progress, but recently I’ve found a better way, using the library [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/). The tqdm library is dead simple to use and displays a progress bar in your terminal (e.g. `100%|██████████████████████████████| 100000/100000 [00:00<00:00, 4016070.78it/s]`) while the Python script is being run. 

To use tqdm, you just need to 1) import it and then 2) wrap an iterable with the tqdm() method. That’s it!

Examples:
```python
from tqdm import tqdm

# Example 1
for i in tqdm(range(100000)):
    # python statements
    ...

# Example 2
for feature in tqdm(featurecollection):
    # process feature
    ...

```

Note: For additional display options type `tqdm –help`.
