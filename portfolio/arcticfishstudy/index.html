			<h4 class="title is-4">Mapping Arctic Fish Data</h4>
			<h5 class="subtitle">Description:</h5> 
			<p>Mapping Arctic fish species was the focus of my final independent project at the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS). Utilizing a large dataset provided by the Canadian Museum of Nature, spatial distribution of the Arctic fish species was investigated through a combination of occurrence maps, ecological zone analysis, and habitat modelling.</p>
			<p>The large dataset used for this research consisted of nearly 40,000 occurrence records and ned across numerous decades. Though the use of python scripts with the arcpy library, automation for the creation of over 1000 maps was performed and was used to illustrate the distribution of Arctic fish, based on their family, genus, and species. Python scripts were also used for the frequency analysis of species occurrence by eco-zone.</p>
			<p>The final stage of this research project was the prediction of species based on environmental factors which influence habitat suitability. Using a combination of background research on a fish species, occurrence data, spatial datasets representing different aspects of the environment, and the Maxent habitat modelling software, suitable locations of a species were determined and presented as a cartographic product.</p>
