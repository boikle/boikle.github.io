			<h5 class="subtitle">Description:</h5>
			<p>This project is a JavaScript Implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton/no-player game, in-which cells on a 2D plane can either be alive or dead. The life status of each cell is determined by its eight neighbouring cell values, and follows the following four rules;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Live cells with less than two live neighbouring cells will die due to under-population.</li>
				<li>A live cell which has either two or three live neighbouring cells, will stay alive for the next generation.</li>
				<li>Live cells with more than three live neighbouring cells will die due to over-population.</li>
				<li>If a dead cell has three live neighbours it will become alive through reproduction.</li>
			</ol>
