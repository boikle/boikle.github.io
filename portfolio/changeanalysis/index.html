			<h4 class="title">Temporal Change Analysis of a Volcano</h4>
			<h5 class="subtitle">Description:</h5>
			<p>The goal of this project was the detection of surface changes caused by the July 17th, 2001 eruption of Mt. Etna (located in Sicily, Italy). Landsat 7 imagery was selected before and after the eruption, with a temporal range of 16 days.</p>
			<p>Using PCI Geomatica's EASI scripting language, the imagery was first prepared, and then temporal change analysis was performed using a variety of methods include Band Ratioing, NDVI difference analysis, SAVI difference analysis and Tasseled Cap Transformation.</p>
			<p>Following the analysis, the results were examined in PCI Geomatica's Focus, then areas of volcanic change were identified, and an unsupervised classification was performed on those selected areas of change. The final result illustrated the locations of both volcanic activity, and areas changed by weather events or humans.</p>
