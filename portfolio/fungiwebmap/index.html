			<h5 class="subtitle">Description:</h5>
			<p>The Fungi Web Mapping project represents a personal spatial project in which I combined my interests in geomatics with spending time outdoors. Using the open source OpenLayers JavaScript library I developed a web-based map, containing occurrence data of fungi I identified while hiking.</p>
			<p>The web map contains hundreds of spatial points of numerous species of fungi, collected using a recreational GPS receiver. Each location had images associated with the identified fungi, and characteristics were recorded for each fungi record. Fungi location data was catalogued/identified, and then stored in a SQLite database. Lastly the SQL database was converted into a geojson format for ease of use in the OpenLayers framework, and then displayed on a web based map.</p>
			<h5 class="subtitle">Project Requirements:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Openlayers</li>
				<li>Field data collection of fungi occurrence locations</li>
				<li>Development and maintenance of a SQL database (SQLite 3)</li>
				<li>Data management and data conversion</li>
			</ul>
