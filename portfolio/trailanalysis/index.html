			<h5 class="subtitle">Description:</h5> 
			<p>This small research project examined three hiking trails in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, with the goal of determining which sections of each trail provide the greatest degree of challenge for hikers.</p>
			<p>Using ArcGIS's 3D Analyst tool set, trails were assessed on the degree of difficulty determined by the length of the trail, and also the slope and aspect of the terrain. The results of the analysis were then intersected with each trail and different colours representing levels of difficulty were used to style trail sections. The final results were then displayed on top of a TIN model illustrating the topography, allowing hikers to see which sections of the each trail posed the greatest challenge.</p>
