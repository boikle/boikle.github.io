			<h4 class='title'>Remote Sensing Capstone Project</h3>
			<h5 class='subtitle'>Description:</h4>
			<p>This capstone project demonstrates the use of common remote sensing operations, including the collection of ground control points (GCP's), orthorectification, producing training data for a supervised classification, and an assessment of the quality of the final classification using confusion matrices results.</p>
			<p>Vector data for surface features, a digital elevation model (DEM), and SPOT 5 satellite imagery was collected for British Columbia's, Okanagan Valley. With the help of these spatial datasets the SPOT 5 imagery was orthorectified in PCI's geomatica. After which training data for the supervised classification was created with special attention given to spectral separability of each class. This resulted in 13 spectral classes (later merged into 7 final classes) representing the landscape of the study area, which were then used for a supervised classification.</p>
			<p>The results of the classification were then assessed for accuracy and a final classification map was produced using ArcGIS.</p>
